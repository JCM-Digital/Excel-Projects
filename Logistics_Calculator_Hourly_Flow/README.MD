# Logistics Hourly Flow Calculator



## Overview
This repository contains "Logistics Hourly Flow Calculator.xlsx," my first Excel file used for practical applications. It's designed to track and analyze hourly logistics flows, crucial for operational management and planning in logistics and supply chain environments.

## About This Project
As my first practical application using Excel, this workbook helps users monitor and calculate various logistics metrics over hourly intervals, aiding in effective decision-making.

## Contents of the Workbook
- **Flow Tracker:** Used for inputting data and viewing the flow of logistics operations across different hours. It includes functions and formulas that calculate totals, averages, and other metrics.
- **List:** Serves as a database or reference for data used in calculations on the main tracker sheet.
- **Sheet2:** Currently unused, reserved for future expansion or additional analysis.

## Usage
This workbook is intended for internal use to monitor daily operations within a logistics framework. Users can input data into the "Flow Tracker" sheet to see real-time updates on logistics performance metrics.

## Future Improvements
Future updates may include automation of data entries, integration with real-time data systems, and enhancements to the visual representation of data through dynamic charts and dashboards. Specifically, the addition of a real-time visual line graph to represent the deltas in logistics flows can significantly enhance the visualization and monitoring of changes over time.

## Conclusion
This workbook marks the beginning of my journey in utilizing Excel for practical and impactful business solutions. It embodies a fundamental tool for operational excellence in logistics management.
